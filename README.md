# FigNAS
* This fork initially tries to keep abreast of XigmaNAS codebase consolidating commits to the same file
* The name change was done to avoid misrepresentation and a missive from the Trademark owner on 2019-09-23
* This fork primarily came into being since the original XigmaNAS code base could not be compiled by me
* It serves me as a base for understanding code changes by organising whitespace and code block movement changes from the actual code changes
* It also provides for code extensions by indicating which files need to be changed for what functionality class

## Building XigmaNAS
* Read the file at `build/README`

## Post Release Updation of web facing files
* The contents of the repo folders need to be oplaced in the root filesystem of the NAS install thus:
	* www => /usr/local/www
	* etc => /etc
	* locale => /usr/local/share/locale

# find / -name "locale"
* Gets all locakle folders and files
